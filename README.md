Its purpose is to demonstrate that even simple meets its functionality which is to have the ability to upload photos and share, is a social network inspired by instagram but in a format much lighter, is a simple feed that is responsible for displaying all of the images shared by users.

## Catpic's Platform

You thought that catpic's is only one application, because let me tell you that no, catpic's is a platform that you can access it from the web or from your application and both share the same database so you can always be connected to the platform and the other users.

## Philosophy

The catpic approach of's is to give the user a simple experience, nothing of subscriptions or followers, it is more a directly way to connected with the content of a community. You can upload a photo and automatically all can see it in the form of post combined with a consumer-friendly aesthetic visual.
catpic's is designed with a mentality or with the pattern of development "Mobile first" since one of the goals is to achieve an instant connection not with the contents of a single person or a group of people, else of the entire community of catpic's.

what we want offer to users are new experiences, different and varied types of content, open the minds of the users and help them know. Many times there is a content type that we might like but that we still do not know and for that we create catpic's with an idea of free movement of media content.

a curious about the name of the platform is due to the fact that originally the page was going to be a social network for cats.
